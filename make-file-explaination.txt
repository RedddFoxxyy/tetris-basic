This Makefile is used to compile and run a game written in C that uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

- **Variable Definitions**:
  - `CC := gcc`: This sets the C compiler to be used to `gcc`.
  - `CFLAGS := sdl2-config --cflags -O3 --std=c99`: This sets the compiler flags. `sdl2-config --cflags` gets the compiler flags for SDL. `-O3` enables all optimization options. `--std=c99` sets the language standard to C99.
  - `LDFLAGS := sdl2-config --libs -lm -lSDL2_ttf`: This sets the linker flags. `sdl2-config --libs` gets the linker flags for SDL. `-lm` links against the math library. `-lSDL2_ttf` links against the SDL2_ttf library, which is used for rendering fonts.
  - `EXTRA_FLAGS :=`: This is an empty variable that can be set to add extra flags.
  - `HDRS :=`: This is an empty variable that can be set to add header files.
  - `SRCS := $(wildcard src/*.c)`: This sets `SRCS` to all `.c` files in the `src` directory.
  - `OBJS := $(SRCS:.c=.o)`: This sets `OBJS` to the `.o` files corresponding to each `.c` file in `SRCS`.
  - `EXEC := game`: This sets the name of the executable file to `game`.

- **Recipes**:
  - The default recipe is `all`, which depends on `compile_run`. This means that when you run `make` without specifying a target, it will run the `compile_run` recipe.
  - The `compile_run` recipe depends on `compile`, and runs the game after it's compiled.
  - The `compile` recipe compiles the object files into an executable.
  - The `debug` recipe runs `make` with extra flags for debugging.
  - The pattern rule `%.o: %.c $(HDRS) Makefile` compiles each `.c` file into a corresponding `.o` file.
  - The `clean` recipe removes the executable and object files, and the Emscripten build directory.
  - The `wasm_build_dir`, `wasm`, `wasm_serve`, and `publish` recipes are used for building and serving a WebAssembly version of the game using Emscripten.

- **Phony Targets**:
  - The `.PHONY: all clean compile compile_run debug wasm wasm_serve wasm_build_dir publish` line declares that all these targets are phony, meaning they don't correspond to actual files.

This Makefile allows you to easily compile and run your game, compile it with debugging symbols, clean up build artifacts, and build and serve a WebAssembly version of your game.
